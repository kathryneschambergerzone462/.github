## 🚀 Pinned Repositories  
Here are some projects I’m particularly proud of:  
- **[Project Alpha](https://github.com/kathryneschambergerzone462/project-alpha)** – A scalable microservices architecture for handling real-time data streams.  
- **[UI Toolkit](https://github.com/kathryneschambergerzone462/ui-toolkit)** – A customizable React component library with full TypeScript support.  
- **[Cloud Deployment](https://github.com/kathryneschambergerzone462/cloud-deployment)** – An AWS-based infrastructure-as-code setup using Terraform and Kubernetes.  
- **[API Gateway](https://github.com/kathryneschambergerzone462/api-gateway)** – A high-performance API gateway built with Go and GraphQL.  

## 🧠 My Approach to Development  
I believe in writing clean, well-documented code and designing systems that are both robust and easy to maintain. I’m a strong advocate for test-driven development (TDD) and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices. Collaboration and communication are key to successful projects, so I always strive to work closely with my team and provide clear, actionable feedback.  

## 🌱 What I’m Currently Learning  
I’m always exploring new technologies to stay up-to-date with industry trends. Right now, I’m diving deeper into:  
- **WebAssembly (Wasm)** for high-performance web applications  
- **Rust** for systems programming  
- **Data Engineering** with tools like Apache Kafka and Airflow
